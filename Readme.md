# dump1090 stream parser

This software takes a [dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) stream of [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast) messages and plops them into a database with a timestamp.

You can read about the general ADS-B "basestation" data format [here](http://woodair.net/SBS/Article/Barebones42_Socket_Data.htm) and [here](https://github.com/wiseman/node-sbs1/blob/master/README.md).

> **Note**: This fork optimizes for efficient data storage by using MySQL table compression, native numeric data types, and casting placeholder values to NULL where possible.

## Usage

You'll need a dump1090 instance running somewhere accessable on your network.

The script also currently relies on a MySQL database hosted on the same machine. (`host=127.0.0.1 database=dump1090 user=dump1090 password=dump1090`) [MySQL innodb table compression](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-compression-background.html) is used, so your mileage may vary depending on your mysql server version and configuration.

If dump1090 is runing on your current machine and you have the database set up, running

```sh
python dump1090-stream-parser.py
```

should automatically connect to it.

Stop the stream by hitting control + c. This will write any remaining uncommitted lines to the database and exit.

> **Note**: This fork also performs some filtering & data processing to turn numeric values into their native mysql times, catch null values, and otherwise optimize for efficient data storage (along with database table compression). This hasnâ€™t been thoroughly tested yet and *may* result in some data loss compared to the original script (and the raw SBS data stream).

###Complete usage and options

```
usage: dump1090-stream-parser.py [-h] [-l LOCATION] [-p PORT]
                                 [--buffer-size BUFFER_SIZE]
                                 [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE]
                                 [--connect-attempt-limit CONNECT_ATTEMPT_LIMIT]
                                 [--connect-attempt-delay CONNECT_ATTEMPT_DELAY]

A program to process dump1090 messages then insert them into a database

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOCATION, --location LOCATION
                        This is the network location of your dump1090
                        broadcast. Defaults to localhost
  -p PORT, --port PORT  The port broadcasting in SBS-1 BaseStation format.
                        Defaults to 30003
  --buffer-size BUFFER_SIZE
                        An integer of the number of bytes to read at a time
                        from the stream. Defaults to 100
  --batch-size BATCH_SIZE
                        An integer of the number of rows to write to the
                        database at a time. A lower number makes it more
                        likely that your database will be locked when you try
                        to query it. Defaults to 100
  --connect-attempt-limit CONNECT_ATTEMPT_LIMIT
                        An integer of the number of times to try (and fail) to
                        connect to the dump1090 broadcast before qutting.
                        Defaults to 10
  --connect-attempt-delay CONNECT_ATTEMPT_DELAY
                        The number of seconds to wait after a failed
                        connection attempt before trying again. Defaults to
                        5.0
```

## Examples

Connecting to dump1090 instance running on a raspberry pi on your local network

```sh
python dump1090-stream-parser.py -l raspberrypi.local
```

Write every record to the database immediately instead of batching insertions
```sh
python dump1090-stream-parser.py --batch-size 1
```

Read larger chunks from the stream
```sh
python dump1090-stream-parser.py --buffer-size 1024
```

Connect to the local machine via ip address and save records in 20 line batches to todays_squitters.db
```sh
python dump1090-stream-parser.py -l 127.0.0.1 -d todays_squitters.db --batch-size 20
```

---

If you have trouble getting dump1090 to emit [multilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateration) (MLAT) data you receive from flightaware, you can make `piaware-config` provide it's own basestation port by doing something like `basestation,listen,31003`, i.e.:

```sh
sudo piaware-config -mlatResultsFormat "beast,connect,127.0.0.1:30104 beast,connect,feed.adsbexchange.com:30005 basestation,listen,31003"
```

And then you can just run another copy of dump1090-stream-parser to catch that data.
```sh
python dump1090-stream-parser.py -p 30003 &
python dump1090-stream-parser.py -p 31003 --batch-size 10 &
wait
```


## Querying

The ICAO address is stored as the raw base10 integer representation of the
24-bit address (which is usually displayed as a 6-character hex string).

The squawk, which is a [four digit octal code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_(aeronautics)#Transponder_codes) (base 8), is also stored as a raw base10 integer.

To query for these or display "normal" output, you can use the `CONV()` function in mysql:

```sql
SELECT transmission_type, CONV(icao_addr, 10, 16) as hex_addr, callsign, altitude, lat, lon, ground_speed, track, CONV(decimal_squawk, 10, 8) as squawk, parsed_time as utctime
  FROM squitters
  WHERE ((lat IS NOT NULL && lon IS NOT NULL) OR (callsign IS NOT NULL))
    AND (icao_addr = CONV("AA3410", 16, 10))
  ORDER BY parsed_time DESC
  LIMIT 50;
```
